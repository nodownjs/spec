# Nodown

The purpose of this documentation is to define the various elements that can be used in Nodown and their syntaxes.

## Introduction

Nodown is a lightweight markup language[^lml] that shares a strong similarity with Markdown. Developed in JavaScript, it was born of the desire to enrich Markdown by integrating additional functionalities, while overcoming certain limitations inherent in standard Markdown.

## Motivations

The creation of Nodown was motivated by the need to centralize the various versions of Markdown, resolve its perceived limitations and clarify the situation by offering a new, centralized solution. Among the motivations were the resolution of limitations such as the native absence of features like tables and the ability to define image sizes without resorting to HTML.

## Main objectives

The main objectives are as follows:

- Enhance Markdown syntax by adding additional features, while preserving its simplicity and ease of use.
- Resolve perceived limitations in standard Markdown, such as the native absence of features like tables, image size definition, etc.
- Centralize the various iterations of Markdown into a single, complete and coherent solution.
- Stay in touch with the community and respond to users' needs and expectations in order to evolve over time.

## Vision

Nodown's vision for the future is to offer a complete solution that is easy to use, modern and continually improved. We are committed to listening to the community and providing tools tailored to users' needs.
